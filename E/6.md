## The Importance of Confidence
#### Whatever one does, one should do it with confidence. If one has no confidence, these is little possibility that one would  ever achieve anything, especially when one is faced with drawbacks and hardships. However, in reality we do see a lot of people who complain that they lack the ability to do something or that it's too difficult to overcome the obstacles. For someone, this might be true. But for many others, this only shows that they may have lost heart.
#### Why do people often feel frustrated even though they are capable of doing something? There are, among others, two main reasons. First, these people do not have a correct estimate of themselves. Second, they overestimate the difficulties.
#### It is possible to build up faith in oneself by having the right attitude towards one's own abilities. We should not underestimate our abilities but believe in the proverb "Where there is a will, there is a way." Confidence is the premise for fulfilling a task.
