##Be Optimistic and Prepared

####There is a thought-provoking saying. "hope for the best, but prepare for the worst." It conveys a philosophy of life that we should have a positive attitude and make sure we are ready for hard times as well.
####In our lives, when we are preparing for significant matters, being optimistic and hoping for the best enable us to have the courage to deal with hardships and obstacles. On the contrary, if one keeps moaning about the setbacks instread of remaining optimistic, he or she would fail to make breakthroughs. As a matter of fact, obstacles are inevitable during our lifetime. If we don't foresee the worst outcome, we will be overwhelmed by the feeling of frustration when we suffer a defeat.
####To summarize, we should be optimistic but ready for adversities as well. Only in this way can we quickly adjust ourselves to the changeable environment.
