#Lifelong Learning Is important

####The saying "learning is a daily experience and lifetime mission" meaningful and full of implication, indicates that whenever we are, we should keep learning. Though it is deduced by our ancestors, it still makes sense in many cases today and has a profound value in our daily life and work.

Though disabled, she kept learning since she was a little child. She finished her college courses and post-graduate courses through self-study, wrote many books, and also translated many WEstern literary works into chinese. In 2010, she was old 55 years old and she started to learning dirving. She keeps learning all her life and becomes a famous writer and translator.
####Bringing what has been discussed into a conclusion, we may say that no matter how old we are and what our situation is, we should keep learning. In a word, I truly agree with the proverb given above and will take the right actions in my life and work in the future.
