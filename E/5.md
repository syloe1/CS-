####As is illustrated in the drawing above, a man is capturing a butterfly with the caption saying, "Happiness is like a butterfly." It informs us that happiness looks exceedingly far away, yet in fact it is just in your hands and it relies on whether you can grasp it or not. Meanwhile, it reveals a thought-pro-voking theme--what is happiness.
####Different people may have different understandings of happiness. The recent studies have shown that there are two main types of happiness. One is instant gratification, such as eating a piece of biscuit, which gives us a temporary rush of pleasure but has no permanent meaning in our lives. The other kind of happiness is that we get from doing something meaningful, such as helping others, learning new skills and making new friends. Most importantly , however, we should regard happiness as a by-product rather than an end product.
####In a word, happiness is never far away from our life but true happiness is more often found in giving rather than in receiving. The new generation of young people should learn how to give and grasp happiness.
