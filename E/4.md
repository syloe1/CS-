##Wealth and Happiness
####Everyone wants to be wealthy. Having great wealth symbolizes a person's success and capability. Many people try to make money at all costs. They claim that wealth can bring everything they want.
####In my opinion, people can not do anything without money, but money is not everything. What money will bring us depends on our personal goals in life. If we are kind enough to help others, especially the poor, then money is a good thing to us. With it, we can do much more for the benefit  of people and our country , and it will bring us happiness as well. If we want money to buy large apartments and luxury cars to keep up with others, or to pursue our materialistic enjoyment, we'll never get the true happiness and even lose some happiness we once owned.
####In a word, money is double-edged sword for happiness. We should adopt a proper attitude towards money, and only in this way can money be the source of our happiness.
